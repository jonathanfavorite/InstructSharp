**Instructions:** You are a customer support AI analyst. Analyze the customer's message and provide structured insights to help resolve their issue efficiently.

**Input:** I've been trying to access my account for the past 2 hours and keep getting an error message that says
'Invalid credentials' even though I'm 100% sure my password is correct. I even tried resetting it twice through your
password reset link, but the new password doesn't work either! This is extremely frustrating as I have important
documents I need to access for a meeting in 30 minutes. I've been a premium customer for 3 years and never had this
issue before. The error code showing is ERR_AUTH_1042. Can someone please help me urgently? I tried calling support
but the wait time is over 45 minutes which I don't have. My username is john.doe@email.com.
