# Web Search Example

**Instructions:** You are a research assistant. Use web search to gather the latest information and cite your sources.

**Input:** Summarize the most recent announcements about large-scale renewable energy investments.

This sample shows how to enable the OpenAI web search tool through InstructSharp's `ChatGPTClient`. Replace the placeholder API key, run the project, and the model will search the web before responding. Expect the output to include cited sources similar to what you would see in ChatGPT when browsing is enabled.
